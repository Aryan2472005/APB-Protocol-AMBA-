# APB-Protocol
üîë Key Features
1. APB Master FSM
   * Implements IDLE, SETUP, and ENABLE phases.
   * Generates PSELx, PWRITE, PENABLE, PWDATA, and PADDR.
   * Handles PREADY handshake from slaves.
   * Supports both read and write transactions.
   * Error detection (PSLVERR) for invalid setups or invalid addresses.

2. APB Slave (Memory-mapped device)
    * Implements a simple 64-byte memory array (mem1[63:0]).
    * Stores write data (PWDATA) at the address provided by the master.
    * Returns stored data during read transactions.
    * Uses registered read/write logic to ensure stability.
    * Generates PREADY signal to indicate transaction completion.

3. Top-Level Integration
    * Supports two slaves (extendable to more).
    * Address bit [8] is used to select between slave1 and slave2.
    * Multiplexes PRDATA and PREADY signals from active slave to the master.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
   1. Write Transaction
        * Master enters setup phase ‚Üí places PWDATA on bus, asserts PWRITE=1.
        * On enable phase, slave latches PWDATA into mem1[address].
        * Slave asserts PREADY=1 to acknowledge transaction.
        * Data is now stored in slave‚Äôs internal memory.
   2. Read Transaction
        * Master enters setup phase ‚Üí places address on bus, asserts PWRITE=0.
        * On enable phase, slave drives data from mem1[address] onto PRDATA.
        * Master captures PRDATA into apb_rd_data_out.
